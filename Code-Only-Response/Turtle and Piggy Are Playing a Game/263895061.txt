There are a couple of issues with your code. The main problem is that you're trying to print `result` (which should be `res`, by the way), but it's not defined as a variable within the loop.

Here's the corrected version:

```Python
def find_maximum(l, r):
    # Find the largest power of 2 within the range [l, r]
    max_power = 0
    while (1 << (max_power + 1)) <= r:
        max_power += 1

    if (1 << max_power) >= l:
        return max_power
    return max_power - 1

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(find_maximum(l, r))

for res in results:
    print(res)
```

This code will now correctly find the maximum power of 2 within each query's range and print out the answers.
