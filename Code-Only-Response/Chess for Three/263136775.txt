This program is designed to simulate a game of chess where three players are involved. The function `chess_for_three` takes the scores of the three players as input and returns the winner or the sum of the two lowest scores if it's not possible for one player to win.

The main part of the program reads in the number of games from the user, then asks for the scores of each game. For each game, it calls the `chess_for_three` function to determine the winner or the sum of the two lowest scores and prints the result.

Here's how the program works:

- If all three players have the same score, the function returns -1 to indicate that there is no clear winner.
- If the total of any two players' scores is greater than the third player's score, then those two players win. The function returns their combined score.
- If none of the above conditions are met, then the winner is the player who has the average of all three scores rounded down to the nearest integer.

For example, if the scores are 10, 15, and 20, the program will return 12 (the average of the two lower scores), because no single player can win.
