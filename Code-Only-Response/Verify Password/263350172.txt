There are several issues with your code:

1. `s.sort()` returns a list, not the modified string `s`. You need to assign the result back to `s`.
2. The condition `if res == s:` will always be false because `res` is a list and `s` is a string.
3. The variable `t` is used as both an integer and a boolean value (in the while loop). It's better to use a separate variable for the loop control.

Here's a corrected version of your code:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    s = sorted(s)  # assign the result back to s
    if s == "".join(sorted(s)):  # check if the characters are in ascending order
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
Note that I also removed the `res` variable and used a more efficient way to check if the characters are in ascending order by comparing the sorted string with the original string using the `join` method.
