The task is to generate the permutation of a given list where all elements except one are in their original order and the remaining element is moved to its correct position.

Here's how this function works:

- It takes two parameters: `lst` (the input list) and `m` (an integer that determines which element should be moved).
- It first removes the first and last elements of the list, then it finds the minimum element in the remaining part.
- The minimum element is removed from the remaining part, and the remaining part is divided into two halves. 
- The function creates a new list (`list_min`) by concatenating the first element of the original list, the second half of the remaining part (in reverse order), and the last element of the original list.
- It also creates another list (`list_max`) from the first half of the remaining part in ascending order.
- Then it assigns indices to each element in the lists `list_min` and `list_max`. The function assigns the smallest index to the minimum element, then increases the index by 1 for each subsequent element in both lists.
- Finally, the function creates a new list (`res`) where each element is replaced with its assigned index from the previous step.

This approach ensures that all elements except one are in their original order and the remaining element is moved to its correct position.
