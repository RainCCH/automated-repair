The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts exactly 1
 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1
 cube from the top of the tower. Is it possible that after 𝑛
 moves, the resulting tower has exactly 𝑚
 cubes?

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛
 and 𝑚
 (1≤𝑛,𝑚≤100
).

Output
For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower with 𝑚
 cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.
