You are given a positive integer 𝑥
. Find any array of integers 𝑎0,𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛−1
 for which the following holds:

1≤𝑛≤32
,
𝑎𝑖
 is 1
, 0
, or −1
 for all 0≤𝑖≤𝑛−1
,
𝑥=∑𝑖=0𝑛−1𝑎𝑖⋅2𝑖
,
There does not exist an index 0≤𝑖≤𝑛−2
 such that both 𝑎𝑖≠0
 and 𝑎𝑖+1≠0
.
It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array always exists.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer 𝑥
 (1≤𝑥<230
).

Output
For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer 𝑛
 (1≤𝑛≤32
) — the length of the array 𝑎0,𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛−1
.

On the second line, output the array 𝑎0,𝑎1,…,𝑎𝑛−1
.

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.
