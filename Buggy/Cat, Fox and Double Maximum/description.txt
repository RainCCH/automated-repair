Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:

You are given an even positive integer 𝑛
 and a permutation†
 𝑝
 of length 𝑛
.

The score of another permutation 𝑞
 of length 𝑛
 is the number of local maximums in the array 𝑎
 of length 𝑛
, where 𝑎𝑖=𝑝𝑖+𝑞𝑖
 for all 𝑖
 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛
). In other words, the score of 𝑞
 is the number of 𝑖
 such that 1<𝑖<𝑛
 (note the strict inequalities), 𝑎𝑖−1<𝑎𝑖
, and 𝑎𝑖>𝑎𝑖+1
 (once again, note the strict inequalities).

Find the permutation 𝑞
 that achieves the maximum score for given 𝑛
 and 𝑝
. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.

†
 A permutation of length 𝑛
 is an array consisting of 𝑛
 distinct integers from 1
 to 𝑛
 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]
 is a permutation, but [1,2,2]
 is not a permutation (2
 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]
 is also not a permutation (𝑛=3
 but there is 4
 in the array).

Input
The first line of input contains an integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of test cases in the input you will have to solve.

The first line of each test case contains one even integer 𝑛
 (4≤𝑛≤105
, 𝑛
 is even) — the length of the permutation 𝑝
.

The second line of each test case contains the 𝑛
 integers 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛
 (1≤𝑝𝑖≤𝑛
). It is guaranteed that 𝑝
 is a permutation of length 𝑛
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛
 across all test cases doesn't exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length 𝑛
 (the array 𝑞
), such that 𝑞
 maximizes the score under the given constraints.
