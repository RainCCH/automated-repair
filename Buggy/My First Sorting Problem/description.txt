You are given two integers 𝑥
 and 𝑦
.

Output two integers: the minimum of 𝑥
 and 𝑦
, followed by the maximum of 𝑥
 and 𝑦
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤100
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 𝑥
 and 𝑦
 (0≤𝑥,𝑦≤9
).

Output
For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of 𝑥
 and 𝑦
, followed by the maximum of 𝑥
 and 𝑦
