Today, Cat and Fox found an array 𝑎
 consisting of 𝑛
 non-negative integers.

Define the loneliness of 𝑎
 as the smallest positive integer 𝑘
 (1≤𝑘≤𝑛
) such that for any two positive integers 𝑖
 and 𝑗
 (1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛−𝑘+1
), the following holds:
𝑎𝑖|𝑎𝑖+1|…|𝑎𝑖+𝑘−1=𝑎𝑗|𝑎𝑗+1|…|𝑎𝑗+𝑘−1,
where 𝑥|𝑦
 denotes the bitwise OR of 𝑥
 and 𝑦
. In other words, for every 𝑘
 consecutive elements, their bitwise OR should be the same. Note that the loneliness of 𝑎
 is well-defined, because for 𝑘=𝑛
 the condition is satisfied.

Cat and Fox want to know how lonely the array 𝑎
 is. Help them calculate the loneliness of the found array.

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer 𝑛
 (1≤𝑛≤105
) — the length of the array 𝑎
.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 (0≤𝑎𝑖<220
) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛
 over all test cases doesn't exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, print one integer  — the loneliness of the given array.
