There is a sequence 𝑎0,𝑎1,𝑎2,…
 of infinite length. Initially 𝑎𝑖=𝑖
 for every non-negative integer 𝑖
.

After every second, each element of the sequence will simultaneously change. 𝑎𝑖
 will change to 𝑎𝑖−1∣𝑎𝑖∣𝑎𝑖+1
 for every positive integer 𝑖
. 𝑎0
 will change to 𝑎0∣𝑎1
. Here, |
 denotes bitwise OR.

Turtle is asked to find the value of 𝑎𝑛
 after 𝑚
 seconds. In particular, if 𝑚=0
, then he needs to find the initial value of 𝑎𝑛
. He is tired of calculating so many values, so please help him!

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛,𝑚
 (0≤𝑛,𝑚≤109
).

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the value of 𝑎𝑛
 after 𝑚
 seconds.
