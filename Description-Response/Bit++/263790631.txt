The issue with your code is that it's not correctly parsing the operation and variable from each statement. Specifically, the condition `st[1] == "+"` is trying to check if the second character of the string is a "+", but this won't work because the variable "X" is always present in the statement.

Here's the corrected code:

```
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n) :
    st = input()
    if '++' in st:
        x += 1
    elif '--' in st:
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

In this corrected version, we're using the `in` operator to check if the string contains either "++" or "--". This way, we can correctly identify whether the operation is incrementing or decrementing the value of `x`.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
