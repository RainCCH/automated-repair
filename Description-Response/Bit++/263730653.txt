The bug in your code is that you're not actually checking for the conditions correctly. The `input()` function returns a string, so when you do `l.append=input()`, it's actually assigning the return value of `input()` to `l` instead of appending it.

Also, when you check for the conditions, you should be comparing strings using `.strip()` or `.lower()` to ensure that the condition is met regardless of the order in which the operation and variable are written. Here's the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())
program = []
c = 0

for i in range(n):
    program.append(input().strip())

for i in program:
    if i == "++X" or i.lower() == "x++":
        c += 1
    else:
        c -= 1

print(c)
```

This code should work correctly now. It first reads the number of statements, then reads each statement and stores it in a list called `program`. Then it goes through each statement in the program, checks if it's either "++X" or "x++", and increments or decrements the counter accordingly. Finally, it prints the final value of the counter.
