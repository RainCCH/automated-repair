The issue with the code is in this part:

```python
res = false
```

In Python, `false` is not a valid keyword. The correct way to represent a boolean value that's equivalent to `false` is by using `False`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    st = str(input())
    n = len(st)
    let, di, res = 0, 0, True
    if (st[0] >= 'a' and st[0] <= 'z'):
        let = 1
    else:
        di = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (st[i] >= 'a' and st[i] <= 'z'):
            if let == 1 and st[i-1] > st[i]:
                res = False
            let = 1
            di = 0
        else:
            if let == 1 or (st[i-1] > st[i]):
                res = False
            let = 0
            di = 1
    if res:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

Additionally, the variable `res` should be initialized as `True`, not `false`.
