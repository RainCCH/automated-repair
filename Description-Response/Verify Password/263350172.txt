I can help you with that. The bug in your code is due to the `sort()` method not actually modifying the string, but returning a new list. 

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
t = int(input())
while t != 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    n = len(s)

    # Check if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order
    digits = [char for char in s if char.isdigit()]
    if digits and not (all(d1 <= d2 for d1, d2 in zip(digits, digits[1:]))):
        print("NO")
        t -= 1
        continue

    # Check if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order
    letters = [char for char in s if char.isalpha()]
    if letters and not (all(l1 <= l2 for l1, l2 in zip(letters, letters[1:]))):
        print("NO")
        t -= 1
        continue

    # Check if there are no digits that come after a letter
    for i in range(n-1):
        if s[i].isalpha() and s[i+1].isdigit():
            print("NO")
            t -= 1
            break
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This code first checks if all the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, then it checks if all the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. After that, it checks if there are no digits that come after a letter. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints "NO" and continues to the next test case. If all conditions are met, it prints "YES".
