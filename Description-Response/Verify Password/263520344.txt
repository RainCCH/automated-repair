The problem with your code is that it doesn't correctly verify if a digit comes after a letter. It checks the same condition in every iteration, which is not correct. Here's how you can fix this:

```Python
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    num = []
    alp = []
    
    if s != s.lower():
        print('NO')
        
        return
    
    for i in range(n):
        c = s[i]
        
        if c.isdigit():
            if len(alp) > 0:
                print('NO')
                
                return
            num.append(int(c))
        else:
            alp.append(c)
    
    if (num == sorted(num)) and (sorted(alp) == alp):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for test in range(int(input())):
        solve()
```

In this code, we maintain a counter `alp` to count the number of letters. If we encounter a digit and there are already some letters (i.e., `alp > 0`), then it means a digit comes after a letter, so we print 'NO' and return.
