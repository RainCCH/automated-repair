The bug in your code is that it only calculates the minimum possible score, not the maximum. The idea behind this problem is to find the largest power of 2 within the range [l, r]. This will give us the maximum number of steps Piggy can take.

Here's a corrected version:

```
def max_score(l, r):
    return r.bit_length() if l == 1 else (r.bit_length() - 1)

def solve():
    data = input().split()

    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        # Calculate the maximum score
        results.append(max_score(l, r))

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This code calculates the maximum possible score by finding the largest power of 2 within the range [l, r]. If l is not equal to 1, then the maximum power of 2 will be one less than the number of bits in r.
