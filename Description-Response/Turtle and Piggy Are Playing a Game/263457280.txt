The issue with your code is that you are not correctly calculating the maximum score. The score will be maximized when Turtle chooses `r` (the upper limit of the range) initially, because Piggy will keep reducing `x` until it becomes 1.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    score = 0
    x = r
    while x > 1:
        for p in range(2, x + 1):
            if x % p == 0:
                x //= p
                score += 1
                break
    print(score)
```

In this code, we start by reading the number of test cases `t`. Then, for each test case, we read the lower and upper limits `l` and `r` of the range. We initialize the score to 0 and set `x` to `r`.

Then, we enter a while loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 1. Inside the loop, we iterate over all numbers from 2 to `x`, inclusive. If `x` is divisible by any of these numbers, we divide `x` by that number and increment the score. We break out of the inner loop once we find a divisor.

Finally, we print the total score.
