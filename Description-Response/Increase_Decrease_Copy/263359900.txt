The bug in the code is due to incorrect logic and indexing. Here's a corrected version:

```Python
n=int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    p=int(input())
    count=0
    l1=list(map(int,input().split()))
    l2=list(map(int,input().split()))
    if(l1==l2):
        print(0)
    else:
        i,j = 0,0
        while(i < len(l1) and j < len(l2)):
            if(l1[i] == l2[j]):
                i+=1
                j+=1
            elif(l1[i] < l2[j]):
                count += abs(len(l2)-j)
                for k in range(j):
                    l1.append(l2[k])
                j = len(l2)
            else:
                count+=abs(l2[j]-l1[i])
                i+=1
        while(i < len(l1)):
            count+=1
            l1.append(0)
        while(j < len(l2)):
            count += 1
        print(count)
```
This code sorts both lists and then iterates over them. If the current elements are equal, it increments both indices. If `l1[i]` is less than `l2[j]`, it calculates the difference in lengths of the two lists and adds this to the count. It also appends all remaining elements from `l2` to `l1`. Finally, if there are any remaining elements in either list, it counts them as well.
