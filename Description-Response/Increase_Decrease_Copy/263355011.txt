The code has a few issues. Here's the corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())
output = []

for k in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # convert to integer list
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))  # convert to integer list

    steps = 0
    diff = 0

    for i in range(n):
        diff += abs(b[i] - a[i])
        if a[i] < b[n]:
            steps += b[n] - a[i]
        elif a[i] > b[n]:
            steps += a[i] - b[n]

    output.append(steps + diff)

print(output)
```

The issues with the original code are:

1. `a` and `b` were not properly converted to integer arrays.
2. The calculation of `steps` was incorrect. It should be the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
3. The condition in the second loop was incorrect. The correct condition is that if `a[i] < b[n]`, then we need to increase all elements in `a` up to `a[i]`. Similarly, if `a[i] > b[n]`, then we need to decrease all elements in `a` down to `b[n]`.
4. The final calculation of the minimum number of operations was incorrect.

The corrected code should now produce the correct output for each test case.
