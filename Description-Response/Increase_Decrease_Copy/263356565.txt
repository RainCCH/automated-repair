I can help you with that. The problem with your code is that it doesn't correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform array `a` into array `b`. 

Here's a correct version of your code:

```
n=int(input())
arrA=[]
arrB=[]
arrA_input = input().split(',')
for num in arrA_input:
    arrA.append(int(num))
arrB_input = input().split(',')
for num in arrB_input:
    arrB.append(int(num))

arrA.append(arrB[-1])
count=0
prev_sum = 0
for i in range(n+1):
    curr_sum = sum(arrA[:i+1])
    count += abs(curr_sum - prev_sum)
    prev_sum = curr_sum

print(count)
```

In this code, we first read the input arrays `a` and `b`. Then we append the last element of array `b` to the end of array `a`, as required by the problem.

Next, we initialize a counter for the number of operations and keep track of the sum of elements in array `a` up to each position. We calculate the absolute difference between this sum and the previous sum, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the array from its current state to the next state. We add this difference to our total count.

Finally, we print out the total count, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform array `a` into array `b`.

This code should work correctly and give you the desired output for any given input.
