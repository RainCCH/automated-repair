The issue with the code is that it's not correctly implementing the sequence update rule. Here's the corrected code:

```python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    a = [i for i in range(n+1)]
    
    if m == 0:
        print(a[n])
    else:
        for _ in range(m):
            new_a = []
            for i in range(len(a)-2, -1, -1):
                new_a.append((a[i-1]|(a[i]<<1)|a[i+1]))
            a = new_a
        print(a[n])
```

The main issue was that the code wasn't correctly implementing the sequence update rule. The rule is to update each element based on its previous, current, and next elements, using bitwise OR (`|`) and left shift (`<<`). This is implemented in the corrected code by iterating over the list of values `a`, updating each value based on its previous, current, and next neighbors, and then replacing the original list with the updated list.
