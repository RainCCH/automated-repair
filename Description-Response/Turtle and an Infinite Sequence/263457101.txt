The issue with your code is that you're updating the sequence incorrectly. In particular, when updating `a[i]`, you're using `a[i+1]` which may not exist if `i` is close to `n`. Also, you're not considering the edge cases for `m=0` and `n=0`.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```Python
def get_an(n, m):
    # The initial sequence is 0, 1, 2, ...
    a = list(range(1, n + 1))

    # Simulate the changes for m seconds.
    while m > 0:
        temp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            temp[i] = a[i - 1] | a[i] | a[i + 1]
        if n > 0: 
            temp[0] = a[0] | a[1]
        a = temp
        m -= 1

    # Return the value of a_n.
    return a[n]


# Get the number of test cases.
t = int(input())

# Process each test case.
for _ in range(t):
    # Get the values of n and m.
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the value of a_n and print it.
    print(get_an(n, m))
```

This code creates a temporary array to store the updated sequence. It iterates over each element in the original sequence, updating its corresponding index in the temporary array based on its previous value and its next value (if it exists). This ensures that the updated values are correct even when `i` is close to `n`.
