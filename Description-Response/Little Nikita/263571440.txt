The problem with your code is that you're not handling the case where Nikita can put exactly 𝑛
 cubes on top of an initially empty tower. This happens when `m == n`. You should output "yes" in this case, but your current code only checks if `m` is equal to `n` and then outputs "yes". 

Here's a corrected version:

```Python
e = int(input())
while e > 0:
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m > n:
        print("No")
    else:
        print("Yes" if (m == n) or ((n - m) % 2 == 0) else "No")
    e -= 1
```

In this code, we use the `map` function to convert both `n` and `m` to integers at the same time. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

Also, note that I changed `e = e - 1` to `e -= 1`. The latter is a more Pythonic way of decrementing a variable by 1.
