The problem with your code is that you are using the `and` keyword to check two conditions simultaneously. However, in Python, when multiple conditions are separated by `and`, they must all be true for the expression to evaluate to True. 

In your case, since `(m+n) % 2 == 0` can also be False even when `m > n`, it's not a reliable way to check this condition.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```Python
t = int(input())
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    if (n + m) % 2 == 0 and m <= n:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

while t > 0:
    solve()
    t -= 1
```

This code will correctly determine whether it's possible for Nikita to obtain a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
