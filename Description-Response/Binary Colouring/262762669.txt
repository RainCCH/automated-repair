The code you provided is trying to solve the problem by iteratively generating the array a0, a1, ..., an-1. However, there are a few issues with your code:

1. The logic for generating the array is incorrect. You're using bitwise operations to generate the array, but this is not the correct way to generate the array.
2. The while loop after the second for loop is unnecessary and may cause the program to run indefinitely.
3. The code does not correctly handle the case where n > 1.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```Python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    ans = []
    i = 0
    while i <= 31:
        if (x >> i) & 1:
            ans.append(1)
        else:
            ans.append(-1 if sum([2**j for j in range(i+1)]) % 2 else 0)
        i += 1

    n = len(ans)
    while n > 0 and ans[n - 1] == 0:
        n -= 1

    print(n)
    for k in range(n):
        print(ans[k], end=" ")
    print()
```

This code first generates the array by checking the bits of x. If a bit is set, it adds 1 to the array; otherwise, it calculates the corresponding power of 2 and checks if it's odd or even (even powers of 2 will be -1 in the array). The rest of the code is similar to yours.
