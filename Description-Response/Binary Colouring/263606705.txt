The main issue with your code is that it's not correctly generating the array `a0, a1, ..., an-1` and checking if it satisfies all the conditions given in the problem statement.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```Python
def find_array(x):
    n = 1
    while 2**n - 1 <= x:
        n += 1

    array = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (x - (2**i)) >= (2**(i+1)):
            array.append(0)
        elif (x - (2**i)) < 0:
            array.append(-1)
        else:
            array.append(1)

    return n, array

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    n, array = find_array(x)
    print(n)
    print(' '.join(map(str, array)))
```

This code first calculates the length `n` of the array by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`. Then it constructs the array by iterating from 0 to `n-1` and adding `-1`, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is greater than, less than, or equal to the current power of 2.

Please note that this code assumes that the input will always be a positive integer less than `230`. If this is not guaranteed by your problem statement, you may need to add additional error checking.
