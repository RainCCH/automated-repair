The bug in your code is that you are not storing the test cases and their corresponding results. You are just printing -1 as soon as you encounter an invalid case.

Here's a modified version of your code:

```Python
rounds = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(rounds):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1+p2+p3)%2!=0:
        results.append(-1)
    elif (p1+p2) >= p3:
        results.append((p1+p2+p3)//2)
    else:
        results.append(p1+p2)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code will store the results for each test case and then print them all at once.
