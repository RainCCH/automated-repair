The problem with your code is that you are assuming that the only way to get a score of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is by having played exactly `p1` games where both players scored 0, exactly `p2-p1` games where one player scored 2 and the other scored 0, and exactly `p3-p2` games where both players scored 1. This is not necessarily true.

Here's a revised version of your code that correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws:

```
a=int(input())
for i in range(a):
    b=list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
    ma=0
    s=b[0]+b[1]+b[2]
    if s%3!=0:
        print("-1")
        continue
    for j in range(s//3):
        ma+=2
    print(str(ma))
```

In this code, we first check if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is a multiple of 3. If it's not, then there's no way to get those scores by playing games between the three players, so we print `-1`. Otherwise, we calculate the maximum possible number of draws as the integer division of `s/3`, which represents the total number of games played divided by 3 (since each game with a draw is equivalent to one game where both players scored 1). We then print this value.
