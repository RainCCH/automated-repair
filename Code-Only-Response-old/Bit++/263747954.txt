A simple but fun problem!

The code you provided is almost correct. However, there are a few issues:

1. The `input()` function should be wrapped in an `int()` to convert the input to an integer.
2. The variable name `n=int(intput())` should be corrected to `n = int(input())`.
3. The print statement should be indented correctly.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n):
    st = input()
    if st[1] == '+':
        x += 1
    else:
        x -= 1
print(x)
```
Now, let me explain what this code does:

The program takes an integer `n` as input. Then, it iterates `n` times, reading a string `st` each time. If the second character of `st` is '+', it increments the variable `x`. Otherwise, it decrements `x`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `x`.

This code seems to be solving some kind of simple arithmetic operation based on a sequence of strings. The "+1" or "-1" operations are determined by the characters in the input strings.

Well done on writing this code!
