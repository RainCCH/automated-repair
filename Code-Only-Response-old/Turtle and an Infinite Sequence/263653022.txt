The problem you are trying to solve is the bitwise representation of a range. The function `bitwise_range_or` calculates the bitwise OR of all numbers in the range from `l` to `r`. 

However, there seems to be an issue with your code. You have defined `result = bitwise_range_orr(left, right)` but you haven't defined the function `bitwise_range_orr`. It should be `bitwise_range_or` instead.

Here is the corrected code:

```
import math

def bitwise_range_or(l,r):
    diff=r-l
    x=int(math.log(diff,2))
    ans=l
    for i in range(0,x+1):
        ans=ans|(1<<i)
    return ans

T=int(input())

for t in range(0,T):
    n,m=map(int,input().split(" "))
    left=n-m
    right=n+m
    
    if(left<0):
        left=0
    
    result = bitwise_range_or(left, right)
    print(result)
```

This code first calculates the difference between `r` and `l`. Then it calculates the number of bits required to represent this difference using logarithm. It then creates a mask with all bits set from the least significant bit up to the calculated bit position and ORs this mask with `l` to get the bitwise representation of the range.
