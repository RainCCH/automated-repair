This is a Python program that calculates the `n`-th element of a sequence after `m` iterations of a specific transformation. The sequence starts with the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `get_an` function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
2. It initializes an array `a` with the first `n+1` natural numbers.
3. For each of the `m` iterations, it updates the elements of the sequence using a bitwise OR operation (`|`) between consecutive elements, wrapping around to the beginning of the sequence when necessary (i.e., `a[i] = a[i-1] | a[i] | a[i+1]`). The first element is updated separately by taking the bitwise OR with the second element.
4. Finally, the function returns the value of the `n`-th element (`a[n]`) after `m` iterations.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` from input, and then processes each test case by:
1. Reading the values of `n` and `m` as separate integers.
2. Calling the `get_an` function with these values.
3. Printing the result.

Note that this implementation assumes that the bitwise OR operation is performed between elements in the sequence, which might not be the intended behavior if you're looking for a different transformation rule.
