Your code is correct and should work as expected. It reads a number of test cases from standard input, calculates the maximum possible score for each test case, and prints out the scores.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The `max_score` function takes two integers, `l` and `r`, and returns the minimum of their integer division (`r // l`) and their own value (`l`). This is because the maximum possible score for a test case with `n` correct answers out of `m` total questions is either `min(n, m)` or when `n > m`, it's still just `min(n, m)`. 

2. The `solve` function reads a line from standard input, splits it into tokens using spaces as separators, converts the first token to an integer (`t`) and interprets it as the number of test cases. It then initializes an empty list `results` and sets `index` to 1.

3. The function then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers from standard input (`l` and `r`), calculates their maximum possible score using the `max_score` function, and appends the result to the `results` list. It then increments `index` by 2 to skip over the newline character that separates the test cases.

4. Finally, the function prints out each of the scores in the `results` list.

The code should work correctly as long as the input is well-formed and follows the expected format.
