This is a Python solution for the problem of finding the maximum gap between two consecutive ones in a binary array. The binary array is given as input, and the program should output the maximum gap.

Here's how it works:

1. It first reads the number of test cases (tc). Then for each test case:
2. It initializes an array `prev_position` to keep track of the previous position of ones in the binary array.
3. It also initializes another array `pos_diff` to store the difference between current and previous positions of ones.
4. It reads the number of elements (n) in the binary array, then reads the array itself from input.
5. For each element in the array, it checks which bits are set (i.e., 1). If a bit is set, it updates `pos_diff` with the maximum difference between current and previous positions for that bit, and also updates `prev_position` with the current position.
6. Then it goes through the array again to find the maximum gap by updating each element in `pos_diff` with the maximum of its current value and the length of the array minus its previous position. It keeps track of the maximum gap found so far (`ans`) and prints it at the end.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the binary array, because we are iterating over the array twice: once to update `prev_position` and `pos_diff`, and again to find the maximum gap. The space complexity is also O(n) for the same reason.
