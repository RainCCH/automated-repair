This code is solving a problem where it takes a permutation `p` and returns another permutation `q`. The permutation `q` is constructed by moving the local maxima in the array `a` (which is derived from `p`) to the end of the array.

Here's how the function works:

1. Sorts the permutation `p` in ascending order.
2. Creates an array `a` where each element is the sum of its index and the corresponding element in `p`. This array represents a modified version of the permutation `p`.
3. Identifies all local maxima in the array `a`. Local maxima are elements that are greater than their neighbors. These elements will be moved to the end of the array.
4. Creates an array `q` where each element is the difference between its corresponding element in `a` and `p`. This array represents the permutation `q`.

In the example usage, if we have a permutation `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, the function will return the permutation `[1, 2, 2, 2]`.
