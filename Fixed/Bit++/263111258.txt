There are a few issues with your code:

1. `x = o` should be `x = 0`, since you can't assign an integer value to a variable using the keyword `o`.
2. The condition in the while loop is incorrect. You want to check if `t` is equal to 0, not not equal to 0.
3. The variable `s` is supposed to be a string input by the user, so you can't directly compare its second character with an integer.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
x = 0
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    s = input()
    if s[1] == "+":
        x += 1
    elif s[1] == "-":
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

This code will work as follows:

- It first initializes `x` to 0.
- Then it reads an integer value `t`.
- The while loop runs until `t` becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, it reads a string input from the user and checks its second character (`[1]` index).
- If the second character is "+", it increments `x` by 1.
- If the second character is "-", it decrements `x` by 1.
- Finally, after all inputs have been processed, it prints the value of `x`.
