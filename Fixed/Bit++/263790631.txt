This code is supposed to count the number of strings that start with "+", but there's a problem. The variable `X` (which should be `x`) is not defined, so when you try to subtract from it (`X -= 1`), Python will throw an error.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n):
    st = input()
    if st[0] == "+":
        x += 1
    else:
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

This code works by iterating over `n` strings. For each string, it checks the first character (`st[0]`). If the first character is "+", it increments the count `x`. Otherwise, it decrements the count. Finally, it prints the total count.

Note that I also changed `X -= 1` to `x -= 1`, as you should be updating the same variable `x` throughout the loop.
