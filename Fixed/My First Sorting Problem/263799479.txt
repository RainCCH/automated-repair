Your code seems to be correct and should work fine. However, there are a few things you can do to make it more efficient:

1. You don't need `t+1` in the range function because the input() statement is only called once.

2. Instead of printing both values every time, you can print them conditionally as you're doing now.

Here's how your code could look like after these improvements:

```Python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x < y:
        print(x, ' ', y)
    else:
        print(y, ' ', x)
```
This code reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case it reads two numbers `x` and `y`. It compares these numbers and prints them in the required order.
