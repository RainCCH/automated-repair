This is a Python script that solves a problem on a certain platform. It seems to be a programming contest problem.

The script takes as input the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads in three integers: `n` (the size of an array), and two arrays `a` and `b` of length `n`. 

It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`. Then it checks if all elements in `b` are less than or equal to the last element in `b`, and all elements in `a` are greater than or equal to the last element in `b`. If this condition is met, it calculates the minimum distance from the last element in `b` to any element in `b` or `a`, adds 1, and prints the result. Otherwise, it just prints the sum of absolute differences.

Here's a simplified version of the script:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = sum(abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(a, b))
    
    flag = 1
    if all(b[i] <= b[-1] for i in range(n)) and all(a[i] >= a[-1] for i in range(n)):
        mn = min(abs(b[-1] - x) for x in b) + min(abs(b[-1] - x) for x in a)
    else:
        mn = 0
    
    print(res + mn + 1)
    t -= 1
```

Note: The `maxSize` variable is not defined in the script. It's likely that it should be replaced with the actual maximum size of an array, or removed if it's not necessary for the problem.
