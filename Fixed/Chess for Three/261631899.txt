A nice problem!

Let's break it down:

The input consists of two parts: the number of rounds `rounds` and the number of players `n`.

For each player, we have three scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The rules are:

1. If the sum of any two players' scores is equal to the third player's score, the game ends.
2. If the total score of all three players is even, the winner is the one with the highest average score (i.e., `(p1+p2+p3)//2`).
3. Otherwise, if the total score is odd, there is no winner.

Here are some observations:

* The sum of any two players' scores must be an integer (since they're all integers). This means that `(p1+p2+p3)` must also be an integer.
* If `(p1+p2+p3)` is even, then we can check if the average score is at least the third player's score. If it is, then the winner is the one with the highest average score.

Now, let's modify your code to make it more efficient and readable:

```python
rounds = int(input())
n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    
    if (p1+p2+p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        avg = (p1+p2+p3)//2
        winner = max(p1, p2, p3)
        
        if avg >= winner:
            print(avg)
        else:
            print(winner)
```

We've removed the unnecessary `results` list and simplified the conditions. We also used a more readable way to find the maximum score (using `max`) instead of writing it out explicitly.

Give this code a try, and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
