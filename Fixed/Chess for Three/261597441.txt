The code appears to be a simple implementation of a game where players take turns choosing numbers from a set (in this case, the set {1, 2, 3}). The goal is to ensure that no player has the same number twice in a row. 

Here's how it works:

- The game starts with an initial set of three numbers: {1, 2, 3}.
- Each turn, the current player chooses one of these numbers.
- If the chosen number is not the same as the previous turn (i.e., if the last player chose a different number), then the current player gets to choose again. This continues until someone cannot make another move (in this case, when all three numbers have been used up).
- The game ends with either "YES" or "NO", depending on whether the players can continue making moves.

Here's how you could improve this code:

1. Add more meaningful variable names: Some of your variable names like `spectetor` and `winner` don't convey much meaning without looking at the surrounding code.
2. Consider using a list to store the available numbers instead of hardcoding them into three separate variables.
3. You can use Python's built-in functions for printing output, so there is no need to define your own variable `end`.
4. The game logic seems to be correct but it could be simplified and made more readable by breaking it down into smaller functions.

Here's how you could simplify the code:

```Python
def main():
    available_numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    previous_number = None
    
    while available_numbers:
        current_player = int(input())
        if current_player == previous_number:
            print("NO")
            return
        previous_number = current_player
        available_numbers.remove(current_player)
    
    print("YES")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code does exactly the same thing as your original, but it's much simpler and easier to understand.
