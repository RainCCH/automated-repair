This Python script calculates the logarithm base 2 of a given integer.

Here's how it works:

1. It first takes an integer input `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. The script then enters a loop that continues until `t` becomes zero.
3. Inside the loop, it takes a string input `a`, splits it into two parts at the space character (`' '`) and converts the second part (index 1) to an integer `b`.
4. It then calculates the logarithm base 2 of `b` using the `math.log2()` function from Python's built-in math module.
5. Finally, it prints the result as an integer.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

```
t = int(input())  # get the number of test cases
while(t>0):      # loop through each test case
    a=(input())   # get the input string for this test case
    val=a.split(' ')  # split the string into two parts at the space character
    b=int(val[1])     # convert the second part to an integer
    print(int(math.log2(b)))  # calculate and print the logarithm base 2 of b as an integer
```

This script assumes that the input strings are in the format "word [number]" where "word" is any string, and "[number]" is a number.
