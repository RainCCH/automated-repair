I'd be happy to help you fix the code! 

There are a few issues with your code:

1. The variable `e` is being decremented in each iteration of the loop, but it's not clear what this variable represents or why it's being decremented. It seems that you might want to loop until `e` reaches 0, which means you should initialize `e` to a value and decrement it inside the loop.

2. The input values for `n` and `m` are strings, so when you're comparing them using greater than (`>`), it will raise a TypeError because integers cannot be compared with strings. You need to convert these strings into integers before making any comparisons.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
e = int(input("Enter the number of test cases: "))
for _ in range(e):
    n, m = map(int, input("Enter two numbers (n and m): ").split())
    if m > n:
        print("no")
    else:
        if m == n or m % 2 == 0:
            print ("yes")
        else:
            print("no")
```

In this code:

- I've initialized `e` with the user's input, which is the number of test cases.
- Inside the loop, I'm converting the input strings into integers using `map(int, ...)` before splitting them into `n` and `m`.
- The rest of the logic remains the same as in your original code.
