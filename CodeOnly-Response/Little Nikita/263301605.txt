The problem with your code is that you're not preserving the order of elements when rotating the list. Here's a corrected version:

```Python
n = int(input())

for _ in range(n):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = sorted(b)
    
    for j in range(a):
        if b == x:
            print("yes")
            break
        else:
            b.insert(0, b.pop())  # rotate the list
    
    else:
        print("no")
```

In this corrected code, I've used `insert` and `pop` methods to shift the first element of the list to the end. This effectively rotates the list in a circular manner.
