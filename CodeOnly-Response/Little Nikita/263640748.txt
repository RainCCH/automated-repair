The issue with your code is that the condition in the `if` statement is incorrect. You are using the `and` keyword to check two conditions, but you need to use parentheses to group these conditions correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
t = int(input())
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    x = (m+n) % 2
    if ((x==0) and (m>n)):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

while (t>0):
    solve()
    t = t-1
```

In this code, we are checking two conditions: `x == 0` and `m > n`. The first condition checks if the sum of `n` and `m` is even. The second condition checks if `m` is greater than `n`. If both conditions are true, then we print "YES", otherwise we print "NO".
