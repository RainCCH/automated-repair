The issue with this code is that the loop iterates over `size` elements of `inp`, but it tries to access `inp[i+1]` which can go out of range when `i` is `size-1`. This will result in an `IndexError`.

Here's a corrected version:

```Python
n=int(input())
while(n>0):
    n=n-1
    size=int(input())
    inp=input()
    prev=ord(inp[0])
    op=1
    for i in range(0,min(size-1,size)-1):  # iterate till second last element
        if ord(inp[i])>ord(inp[i+1]):
            op=0
            break
    if op:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This code ensures that it doesn't go out of range by using `min(size-1,size)-1` as the upper limit in the loop. This way, even if `size` is 1 or less, it will not attempt to access an element beyond the end of the string.
