The issue with your code is that you are trying to sort a string which doesn't support the sort function. In Python, strings are immutable and cannot be changed in place. 

Here's how you can fix it:

```Python
t=int(input())
while t!=0:
    n=int(input())
    s=input()
    n=len(s)
    res=''.join(sorted(s))
    if res == s:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

In this corrected code, I'm using the `sorted` function to sort the characters in the string, and then using `''.join(...)` to concatenate them back into a string.
