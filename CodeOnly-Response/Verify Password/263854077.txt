The main issue with this code is that there are several logical errors and inconsistencies. Here's the corrected version:

```Python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    st = str(input())
    n = len(st)
    let, di = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        if st[i].islower():
            if let == 1 and st[i-1].isupper() or (i == 0 and not st[i].isalpha()):
                print("NO")
                break
            let = 1
            di = 0
        else:
            if let == 1 or (st[i-1] > st[i]):
                print("NO")
                break
            let = 0
            di = 1
    else:
        print("YES")
```

Changes made:

1. The boolean variable `res` is not necessary and has been removed.
2. The condition for checking whether the string starts with a lowercase letter or not has been corrected.
3. The loop variable `i` should be initialized to 0, not 1.
4. The conditions inside the if-else blocks have been corrected.
5. A break statement is added after printing "NO" in case of an error. This prevents unnecessary further processing when an error is encountered.
6. An else block is added for the loop. If no errors are encountered during the loop, then it prints "YES".
