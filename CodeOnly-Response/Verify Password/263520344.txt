The problem with your code is that it's not correctly handling the case when a number is composed of multiple digits. For example, if the input string is "123", your code will print 'NO' because it sees a digit followed by another digit.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```Python
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    
    num = []
    alp = []
    
    if s != s.lower():
        print('NO')
        
        return
    
    for i in range(n):
        c = s[i]
        
        if c.isdigit():
            temp_num = ''
            
            while i < n and c.isdigit():
                temp_num += c
                i += 1
                if i < n:
                    c = s[i]
                
            num.append(int(temp_num))
        else:
            alp.append(c)
    
    if (num == sorted(num)) and (alp == sorted(alp)):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for test in range(int(input())):
        solve()
```

This version of the code will correctly handle numbers that are composed of multiple digits. It does this by using a while loop to keep reading digits as long as it finds them, and then adding the number to the list.
