The code seems to be checking whether a given password meets certain criteria. The criteria are:

1. The password should not have more than one digit.
2. There should not be a digit following an alphabet letter.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
def check(num,pwd):
    a=False
    count1=0
    b=False
    count2=0
    i=1
    while (i<num) and ord(pwd[i])<58 and ord(pwd[i])>46:
        if ord(pwd[i-1])-ord(pwd[i])<0:  # Changed num-1 to num, as the loop should go till 'num'
            a=True
        i+=1
        
    while i<num:
        if ord(pwd[i])-ord(pwd[i+1])>30: #There is an digit after alphabet
            return False                    
        if (ord(pwd[i])-ord(pwd[i+1])<0):
            b=True    
        i+=1 
    if count1<=1:
        a=True
    if count2<=1:
        b=True
    return (a and b)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n=int(input())
    s=input()
    if check(n,s):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

In the original code, the condition `while (i<num-1)` was causing issues because it would stop iterating when it encounters a digit or a special character. This has been corrected by changing it to `while i<num`.
