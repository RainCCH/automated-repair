The issue with the code is that it's not correctly calculating the bitwise OR of all integers between L and R. The problem lies in the way you're updating L and R.

Here's a corrected version:

```
# Returns the Most Significant Bit Position (MSB)
def MSBPosition(N):
    msb_p = -1
    while N:
        N = N >> 1
        msb_p += 1
    return msb_p

# Returns the Bitwise OR of all integers between L and R
def findBitwiseOR(L, R):
    res = 0

    # Find the MSB position in L
    msb_p1 = MSBPosition(L)

    while L <= R:
        res_val = (L | R)
        res += res_val
        L += 1
        R -= 1

    return res

# Driver Code
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    L = max(0, n - m)
    R = n + m
    print(findBitwiseOR(L, R))
```

In this corrected version, we're updating L and R simultaneously by incrementing L and decrementing R until L is greater than R. This ensures that all integers between L and R are included in the bitwise OR calculation.

The MSB position calculation remains the same as it was originally.
