The bug is that you have a typo in the function call. You defined the function as `bitwise_range_or`, but you are trying to call it with `bitwise_range_orr`.

Here is the corrected code:

```Python
import math
def bitwise_range_or(l,r):

    diff=r-l
    x=int(math.log(diff,2))
    ans=l
    for i in range(0,x+1):  # Changed from +2 to +1
        ans=ans|(1<<i)
    return ans

T=int(input())

for t in range(0,T):
    n,m=map(int,input().split(" "))
    left=n-m
    right=n+m
    
   
    if(left<0):
        left=0
    
    result = bitwise_range_or(left, right)  # Corrected the function call
    print(result)
```

Also, I changed the range in the for loop to `range(0,x+1)` because you are already adding 1 when calculating `x`.
