I can help you with that. The issue with the code is that it doesn't correctly calculate the minimum absolute difference between elements in arrays A and B.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
n = int(input())
arrA = []
arrB = []

arrA_input = input().split(',')
for num in arrA_input:
    arrA.append(int(num))

arrB_input = input().split(',')
for num in arrB_input:
    arrB.append(int(num))

arrA.append(arrB[-1])  # This line is not necessary, I assume you had some other logic here

min_diff = float('inf')
count = 0
for i in range(n):
    if arrA[i] != arrB[i]:
        diff = abs(arrA[i] - arrB[i])
        count += diff
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)

print(count + min_diff)  # Add the minimum difference to the total count
```

This code calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements in arrays A and B. If the values at a particular index are different, it adds the difference to the total count. After that, it finds the minimum difference among all differences found so far and adds this to the total count.
