The issue with this code is that it's swapping the values of `x` and `y` when `x` is greater than `y`, but then it assigns the original value of `c` to both `x` and `y`. This means that if `x` was greater than `y`, both variables will be set to the original value of `c`, which is `-1`.

To fix this, you should assign the swapped value to either `x` or `y`, not both. Here's the corrected code:

```
t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    
    if x > y:
        c = x
        x = y
        y = c
    
    print(str(x) + " " + str(y))
```

This way, when `x` is greater than `y`, the values are correctly swapped.
