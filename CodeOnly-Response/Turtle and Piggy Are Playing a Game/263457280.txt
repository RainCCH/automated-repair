I'd be happy to help you fix the code. It looks like there are a few issues:

1. The variable `t` is an integer, but it's being used as an iterable (e.g., in the `for i in range(t):` loop). This won't work.
2. The inner loop is trying to print the value of `n2//c`, but this will only be executed if the condition `n2%c==0` is true. If it's not, the program will continue running without printing anything.
3. There seems to be some confusion about what the code should do. Are you trying to find the smallest factor of `n2`? If so, why are you using `choice = n2` and then ignoring it?

Here's a revised version of your code that addresses these issues:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n2 = int(input())
    for c in range(2, n2):
        if n2 % c == 0:
            print(c)
            break
```
I made the following changes:

* Replaced `i` with `_` to indicate that the variable is not actually used in the loop.
* Moved the input statement inside the outer loop, since you want to read `n2` once per test case.
* Simplified the inner loop by printing the smallest factor found (in this case, `c`) and breaking out of the loop.

Let me know if this revised code meets your requirements!
