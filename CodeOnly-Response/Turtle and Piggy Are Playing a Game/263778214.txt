The issue with your code seems to be that it's not correctly handling the case where there are more than two values in each line of input. 

Here is a revised version of your code:

```Python
import math
t = int(input())
while(t>0):
    val = input().split()
    b=int(val[1])
    print(int(math.log2(b)))
    t -= 1
```

This revised version reads the entire line at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then correctly converts `b` to an integer before calculating the log base 2.

Also, I added `t -= 1` in your while loop condition, because you are supposed to read `t` number of inputs as per your problem statement.
