The code seems to be for a problem where you are given an array of integers and you have to find the maximum gap size between any two consecutive ones in the array.

Here is the corrected code:

```Python
tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_gap = 0
    prev_one = -1
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num == 1:
            if prev_one != -1:
                max_gap = max(max_gap, i - prev_one)
            prev_one = i
    print(max(max_gap, n - prev_one))
```

The problems with your original code are:

1. You were not using the `given` variable correctly. It was supposed to be a list of integers from the input.

2. The logic for calculating `pos_diff` and `prev_position` was incorrect. 

3. In the last part of the code, you were printing the maximum gap size but not considering the case when there is no one in the array (i.e., all numbers are zero).
