The problem with your code is that you are trying to split a string into substrings using `split("")`, which doesn't make sense because the empty string (`""`) doesn't appear anywhere in your binary string. This results in an error.

Here's how you can fix it:

```Python
def integer_to_binary(x):
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    binary_digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % 2
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // 2
    
    # Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct binary representation
    binary_digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list to form a string
    binary_string = ''.join(binary_digits)
    
    print(len(binary_string))
    print(binary_string)

t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    integer_to_binary(x)
```

In this code, I have removed the `x=binary_string.split("")` and `print(*x)` lines because they were causing an error. Now the program simply prints the length of the binary string and then the binary string itself for each input.
