The code seems to be solving a binary number problem. It appears that the input is a binary number and it's supposed to output the length of the longest streak of consecutive ones in the binary representation.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    x = int(input(), 2)

    ans = []

    for i in range(31):
        a = (x >> i) & 1
        ans.append(1 if a > 0 else 0)

    i, streak = 0, 0

    while i < len(ans):
        if ans[i] == 1:
            streak += 1
        else:
            i -= streak
            streak = 0
        i += 1

    print(streak)
```

The issue with the original code is that it's not correctly identifying the longest streak of consecutive ones. The corrected code does this by iterating through the binary representation and keeping track of the current streak. When a zero is encountered, it resets the streak to zero. At the end, it prints out the length of the longest streak.
