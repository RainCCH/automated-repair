I'd be happy to help you fix the code. Here's what I found:

1. The inner `for` loop is printing each element of `q`, but it should be printing the elements of `p`. So, change the inner `for` loop to `for x in range(len(p)):`.
2. The outer `print(x, end='')` statement inside the second `for` loop will print the indices of the elements in `p`, not their values. If you want to print the actual values of `p`, remove the `x` variable and just print each element: `print(p[x], end='')`.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = []
    for x in range(1, n//2+1):
        q.append(x)
        q.append(n+1-x)
    for x in range(len(p)):
        print(p[x], end='')
```
This should fix the code! Let me know if you have any further issues.
