I'd be happy to help you fix the code. The issue seems to be with the sorting logic, where you're trying to sort based on the difference `pi + q[i] - pi-1 - q[i-1]`, but it's not clear what that expression is supposed to mean or how it relates to the permutation.

Assuming this is a permutation problem, I'll make an educated guess and propose a fix. If this isn't correct, please provide more context or clarify the expected output.

Here's the modified code:
```python
# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the length of the permutation and the permutation itself
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize q as a sorted list of indices from 1 to n
    q = list(range(1, n + 1))

    # Sort q based on the value at index i in permutation p
    q.sort(key=lambda x: p[x-1])

    # Print the resulting permutation q
    print(*q)
```
The changes I made were:

1. Removed the expression `pi + q[i] - pi-1 - q[i-1]` since it's unclear what it's supposed to do.
2. Changed the sorting key to simply sort the indices in `q` based on their corresponding values in permutation `p`.

If this fix doesn't work, please provide more context or clarify the expected output, and I'll be happy to help you further!
