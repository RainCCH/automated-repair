Yes, I'd be happy to help you fix the code!

The main issue with this code is that it doesn't declare `o` before using it. In Python, you need to declare variables before using them. Also, there's an undefined variable `s`.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
t = int(input())
x = 0
while t != 0:
    s = input()
    if s[1] == "+":
        x += 1
    elif s[1] == "-":
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

This corrected version declares `o` as `x`, initializes `x` to 0, and uses the correct variable name in the rest of the code.
