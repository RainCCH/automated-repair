The issue with this code is that the variable `y` and `x` are not defined anywhere in the program. It seems like you want to use these variables as limits for a loop, but since they're undefined, the program will throw an error.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```
y = int(input("Enter the value of y: "))
e = 0
for i in range(y):
    u=list(str(x) for x in input("Enter space-separated values for x: ").split())
    for j in u:
        if j == "++X" or j=="X++":
            e+=1
        elif j== "--X" or j=="X--":
            e-=1
print(e)
```

In this code, I added `y = int(input("Enter the value of y: "))` to prompt the user for the value of `y`. Then, I used the same method for `x`, but since `x` is being converted into a list of strings and then iterated over in a loop, you may need to adjust this part based on what kind of data you're working with.

Remember that Python is case-sensitive, so "++X" and "+XP" would be considered different values.
