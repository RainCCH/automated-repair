There are a few issues with this code:

1. The `input()` function is not being called correctly to get the input strings. It should be inside parentheses and separated by commas if you're getting multiple inputs.

2. `l.append=input()` should be `l.append(input())`.

3. In your condition, you can't directly compare a string with "++x" or "x++" because it's checking for exact matches. You need to use the `in` keyword or `.lower().find()` method to check if the string contains these substrings.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())
l = []
c = 0

for i in range(n):
    l.append(input())

for i in l:
    if '++x' in i.lower() or 'x++' in i.lower():
        c += 1
    else:
        c -= 1

print(c)
```

This code will correctly count the occurrences of "++x" and "x++" in the input strings. It converts both the input string and the comparison strings to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
