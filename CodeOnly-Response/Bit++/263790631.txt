The bug in this code is that it doesn't handle the case when `st[1]` is neither "+" nor some other character. This could cause an error if `st[1]` contains a space or any other non-numeric characters.

Also, there seems to be a typo in the line where you're decrementing `x`. It should be `X -= 1` instead of `X -= 1`.

Here is the corrected code:

```
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n) :
    st = input()
    if st[1] == "+":
        x += 1
    elif st[1] != "+":
        try:
            x -= int(st[1])
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
print(x)
```

This code will now correctly increment `x` when it encounters a string that starts with "+", and decrement `x` by the integer value at the second position of each other string, while handling any invalid inputs.
