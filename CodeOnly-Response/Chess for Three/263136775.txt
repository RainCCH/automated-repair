I can help you with that. Your code seems to be correct for the most part, but there are a few things that could improve it.

Firstly, your function `chess_for_three` doesn't return anything, so I added some `return`s at the end of each condition. This way, you're sure what your function will return in any given situation.

Secondly, your print statements were printing directly to the console without being wrapped in a function call (like `print()`). In Python 3.x, the `print` statement is actually a function, so it needs parentheses around its arguments. 

Lastly, you don't need to convert the result of `(p1+p2+p3)/2` back into an integer if you're sure that it will be an integer (like when the sum of the three numbers is even). In Python 2.x, the `/` operator does integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. But in Python 3.x, the `/` operator performs floating point division, so it's better to use `//` for integer division.

Here's your corrected code:

```
def chess_for_three(p1, p2, p3):
    if (p1+p2+p3)%2:
        return -1
    elif((p1+p2)<=p3):
        return p1+p2
    else:
        return int((p1+p2+p3)//2)


num=int(input())
for i in range(num):
    p1=int(input())
    p2=int(input())
    p3=int(input())
    print(chess_for_three(p1, p2, p3))
```
