The issue with your code is that it's not checking if the winner is actually in the array before trying to update the spectetor. Also, it seems like you are implementing a simple game where players take turns and try to avoid each other. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```Python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    spectetor = 3
    winner = 0
    end = "YES"
    
    while n != 0:
        winner = int(input())
        if winner not in arr:
            print("Invalid winner")
            break
        if winner != spectetor:
            for i in range(3):
                if arr[i] != winner and arr[i] != spectetor:
                    spectetor = arr[i]
                    break
        else:
            end = "NO"
            break
        n -= 1
    
    print(end)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code will now correctly update the spectetor and set `end` to "NO" if the winner is the same as the spectetor. It also checks if the winner is actually in the array before updating the spectetor, which should prevent any potential errors.
