The code seems to be mostly correct, but there is a small issue with the last line. It's supposed to append the results to the `results` list instead of printing it directly.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
rounds = int(input())
results = []
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1+p2+p3)%2!=0:
        results.append(-1)
    elif (p1+p2) >= p3:
        results.append((p1+p2+p3)//2)
    else:
        results.append(p1+p2)

print(*results, sep='\n')
```

Now the code will correctly calculate and store the results for each round.
