The issue with your code is that you are trying to split the binary string into individual digits, which is not a valid operation. Also, the logic for constructing the array `a0, a1, ..., an-1` is missing.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
def integer_to_binary_array(x):
    if x == 0:
        return [0], 1
    
    binary_digits = []
    n = 0
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % 2
        binary_digits.append(remainder)
        x = x // 2
        n += 1
    
    # Join the list to form a string
    binary_string = ''.join(str(digit) for digit in binary_digits)
    
    return [int(digit) for digit in binary_string], n + 1

t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    a, n = integer_to_binary_array(x)
    print(n)
    print(*a)
```

This code constructs the array `a0, a1, ..., an-1` by iterating through the binary representation of `x`, appending each digit to the array. The length of the array is determined by the number of iterations needed to construct the binary string.

Please note that this code assumes that there is always at least one valid solution for a given `x`.
