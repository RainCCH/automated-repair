The issue with your code is that the variable `maxSize` is not defined anywhere. You also have some logical issues in your conditions.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```Python
t = int(input())
while(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += abs(a[i]-b[i])

    flag = 1

    # Check if the array 'a' can be transformed into 'b'
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] >= b[i]:
            if b[-1] <= b[i]:
                flag = 0
                break
        else:
            if b[-1] >= b[i]:
                flag = 0
                break

    # Calculate the minimum number of operations
    mn = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        mn = min(mn, abs(b[-1]-b[i]))
    for i in range(n):
        mn = min(mn, abs(b[-1]-a[i]))

    if flag:
        print(res+mn)
    else:
        print(-1)

    t -= 1
```

This code first calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements of arrays 'a' and 'b', which is the minimum number of operations required to transform 'a' into 'b'. Then it checks if array 'a' can be transformed into 'b' by ensuring that no element in 'a' exceeds its copy in 'b'. If this condition holds, then the code prints the calculated minimum number of operations. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that the transformation is not possible.

Note: The variable `maxSize` has been removed as it was not defined anywhere.
