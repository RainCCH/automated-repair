The bug in your code is that it's missing the print statement for the output. Here is the corrected code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n,m = input().split(" ")
    n,m = int(n) , int(m)
    if 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= 100:
        if n >= m:
            print("Yes")
        else:
            print("No")
```

This code will now correctly read the number of test cases, iterate over them, and print "Yes" or "No" for each case based on whether Nikita can obtain a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
