The bug in your code is that it's not correctly checking whether the final state of the tower has `m` cubes. The condition for printing "yes" should be that the last element of the list `b` equals `m`, not just that the sorted list `x` matches `b`.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
n = int(input())

for i in range(n):
    a, m = map(int, input().split())
    for _ in range(a):
        b = [1] + (b[-1:] if b else []) + (b[:-1] if len(b) > 1 else [])
        if len(b) == m:
            print("yes")
            break
    else:
        print("no")
```

This code correctly simulates the moves of Nikita, where he either adds or removes a cube from the top of the tower. It then checks whether the resulting tower has `m` cubes and prints "yes" if it does, otherwise it prints "no".
