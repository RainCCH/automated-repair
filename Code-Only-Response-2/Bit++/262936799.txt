The bug is that the variable `y` is not defined, which causes a `NameError`. To fix this, you can replace `range(y)` with `range(int(input()))`, which reads an integer from the input and uses it as the number of iterations for the loop.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
e = 0
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    u = list(str(x) for x in input().split())
    for j in u:
        if j == "++X" or j == "X++":
            e += 1
        elif j == "--X" or j == "X--":
            e -= 1
print(e)
```
This should fix the bug and produce the correct output.
