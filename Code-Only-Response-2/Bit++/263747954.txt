The issue with your code is that it doesn't correctly identify whether the operation is ++ or --. It simply checks if the second character of the input string is '+', and if not, assumes it's '--'. However, this approach fails to account for cases where the operation is actually '-', but there are no characters before 'X' in the string.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n):
    st = input()
    if st[0] == '+':
        x += 1
    elif st[0] == '-':
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

In this corrected version, we check the first character of the string instead of the second. This ensures that we correctly identify whether the operation is ++ or --.
