The bug in the code is that it doesn't correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. 

A draw can only occur when two players have an even score. Therefore, if a player has an odd score, there must be at least one loss (and possibly multiple losses). This means we need to find the difference between the highest and second-highest scores, as this will give us the maximum number of draws.

Here's the corrected code:

```
def chess_for_three(p1, p2, p3):
    if p1+p2+p3!=6*(p1+p2+p3)//4:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print((p3-p2)//2)

num=int(input())
for i in range(num):
    p1,int(input())
    p2=int(input())
    p3=int(input())
    chess_for_three(p1, p2, p3)
```

In this code, we first check if the sum of all scores is equal to 6/4 times their average. If it's not, then there are no valid game results that can produce these scores, and we print -1. 

If the condition is satisfied, then we calculate the maximum number of draws by subtracting p2 from p3 (which must be even) and dividing by 2.
