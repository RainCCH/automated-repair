The problem with your code is that it's trying to calculate the bitwise OR of all elements in the subarray and then checking if this value is equal to the target. However, you should be calculating the bitwise OR of each element with its next one until you reach the end of the subarray.

Here's a corrected version:

```
def loneliness(a):
    n = len(a)
    
    # Try all possible values of k
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        # Check if the condition is satisfied for all subarrays of length k
        satisfied = True
        target = a[0]
        for i in range(n-k+1):
            temp_target = 0
            for j in range(k):
                temp_target |= a[i+j]
            if temp_target != target:
                satisfied = False
                break
        
        if satisfied:
            return k
    
    # If no value of k satisfies the condition, return n
    return n

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(loneliness(a))
```

This corrected code calculates the bitwise OR of each subarray by iterating over it and adding the bitwise ORs together.
