The problem with your code is that you are not correctly calculating the loneliness of the array. You need to find the minimum k such that for any two positions i and j, a[i]|a[i+1]|...|a[i+k-1] = a[j]|a[j+1]|...|a[j+k-1]. 

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    prev_position = [-1]*20
    n = int(input())
    arr = []
    given = input().split()
    for _ in range(n):
        arr.append(int(given[_]))
    
    k = 0
    while True:
        found_duplicates = False
        for i in range(len(arr)-k-1):
            bitwise_or = 0
            for j in range(k+1):
                bitwise_or |= arr[i+j]
            for j in range(i+len(arr)-i-k, len(arr)):
                if bitwise_or == (bitwise_or | arr[j]):
                    found_duplicates = True
                    break
            if not found_duplicates:
                break
        if found_duplicates:
            k += 1
        else:
            break
    
    print(k+1)
```

This code works by iterating over possible values of k and checking if for any two positions i and j, a[i]|a[i+1]|...|a[i+k-1] = a[j]|a[j+1]|...|a[j+k-1]. If it finds such a k, it stops and prints the value.
