The problem in your code is that you're trying to sort the array `q` based on differences between elements of arrays `p` and `q`, which doesn't make sense for this problem. Instead, you should find the indices where `a[i-1] < a[i] > a[i+1]`. 

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```Python
# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the length of the permutation and the permutation itself
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize q as a sorted list of indices from 1 to n
    q = list(range(1, n + 1))

    # Sort q based on the difference pi + q[i] - pi-1 - q[i-1]
    q.sort(key=lambda i: p[i-1] + (q[i] if i > 0 else 0) - (p[i-1] if i > 0 else 0))

    # Print the resulting permutation q
    print(*q)
```

However, this code still doesn't solve the problem correctly. The score of a permutation `q` is calculated as the number of indices `i` such that `a[i-1] < a[i] > a[i+1]`. 

To fix this, we need to generate all permutations of `q` and calculate their scores. Then, we can print the permutation with the maximum score.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
import itertools

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the length of the permutation and the permutation itself
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize max_score as 0
    max_score = 0

    # Generate all permutations of q
    for q in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):
        score = 0
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = p[i] + q[i]
            if i > 0 and i < n:
                if a[i-1] < a[i] > a[i+1]:
                    score += 1
        
        # Update max_score if the current permutation has a higher score
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            result_q = q
    
    # Print the resulting permutation q
    print(*result_q)
```

This code generates all permutations of `q` and calculates their scores. It keeps track of the permutation with the maximum score and prints it at the end.
