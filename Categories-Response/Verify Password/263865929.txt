The error is likely to be a `NameError` as the variable `input` is not defined within the scope of the for loop. The variable `input` in Python is a built-in function and should not be used as a variable name.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
num_input = int(input("Enter the number: "))
for _ in range(num_input):
    n=int(input())
    s=input()
    if check(n,s):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

def check(num,pwd):
    a=False
    count1=0
    b=False
    count2=0
    i=1
    while (i<num-1) and ord(pwd[i])<58 and ord(pwd[i])>46:
        if ord(pwd[i-1])-ord(pwd[i])<0:
            a=True
        i+=1
        
    while i<num-1:
        if ord(pwd[i])-ord(pwd[i+1])>30:
            return False                    #There is an digit after alphabet
        if (ord(pwd[i])-ord(pwd[i+1])<0):
            b=True    
        i+=1 
    if count1<=1:
        a=True
    if count2<=1:
        b=True
    return (a and b)
```

In this corrected code, I have renamed the variable `input` to `num_input`.
