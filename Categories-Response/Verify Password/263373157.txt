The error in your code is likely a `ValueError` because you are comparing characters using `>` operator which does not work for characters. This comparison should be done alphabetically, not numerically.

Here's the fixed version of your code:

```Python
n=int(input())
while(n>0):
    n=n-1
    size=int(input())
    inp=input()
    prev=ord(inp[0])
    op=1
    for i in range(0,size-1): # subtract 1 because we're not comparing the last character
        if ord(inp[i]) > ord(inp[i+1]):
            op=0
            break
    if op:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This code will correctly determine if a sequence of characters is in ascending order or not.
