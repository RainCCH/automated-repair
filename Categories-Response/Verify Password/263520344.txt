The error is within the category `IndexError: Array Index Out of Bounds`. The issue arises when you try to access an index that does not exist. In your case, it happens when `i < n and (s[i].isdigit() == False and s[i + 1].isdigit() == True)` because `i+1` might be greater than or equal to `n`, which would lead to an error.

Here's the corrected code:

```
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    num = []
    alp = []
    
    if s != s.lower():
        print('NO')
        
        return
    
    for i in range(n):
        c = s[i]
        
        if c.isdigit():
            num.append(int(c))
        else:
            alp.append(c)
    
    if (num == sorted(num)) and (alp == sorted(alp)):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for test in range(int(input())):
        solve()
```

The fix is to only iterate through the string `s` once, without trying to access an index that might be out of bounds.
