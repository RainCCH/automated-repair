The error is within the category "TypeError: Wrong Variable Type".

The issue lies in this line:

```
x=binary_string.split("")
```

You are trying to split a string (`binary_string`) into substrings using an empty string `""`, which is incorrect. The correct way to split a string into individual characters is by splitting it with the character itself, or by using a list comprehension.

Here's the fixed version of your code:

```Python
def integer_to_binary(x):
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    binary_digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % 2
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // 2
    
    # Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct binary representation
    binary_digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list to form a string
    binary_string = ''.join(binary_digits)
    
    print(len(binary_string))
    for char in binary_string:
        print(char)

t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    integer_to_binary(x)
```

I have also fixed the last line of your code. Instead of splitting `binary_string` into individual characters, I am iterating over each character in `binary_string` and printing it.
