The error in this code is likely due to the `ZeroDivisionError: Division by Zero` category, specifically when using the bitwise shift operator (`<<`). This error occurs when trying to shift a number left by more bits than are present in its binary representation.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```Python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    
    ans = []

    for i in range(5, 31):  # Changed range to start from 5
        a = (x & ((1 << i) | (1 << (i-1)) | (1 << (i-2)) | (1 << (i-3)) | (1 << (i-4)))) >> (i-5)
        ans.append(1 if a > 0 else 0)

    i = 0
    while i < len(ans):
        j = i + 1
        if ans[i] == 1 and j < len(ans) and ans[j] == 1:
            while j < len(ans) and ans[j] == 1:
                j += 1
            ans[i] = -1
            for k in range(i + 1, j):
                ans[k] = 0
            ans[j] = 1
        i = j

    n = len(ans)
    while n > 0 and ans[n - 1] == 0:
        n -= 1

    print(n)
    for k in range(n):
        print(ans[k], end=" ")
    print()
```

This code will correctly calculate the binary representation of the input number `x` up to 31 bits. The bitwise shift operator (`<<`) is used to generate each bit of the binary representation, and then the resulting bits are checked for consecutive ones (1s) and adjusted accordingly.

Note that I changed the range in the outer loop to start from 5 instead of 0, as there seems to be no need to calculate bits with values less than 32. Also, I replaced `i < 31` with `i < len(ans)` and similar occurrences throughout the code, since `ans` is a list and its length should be used instead of a fixed number like 31.
