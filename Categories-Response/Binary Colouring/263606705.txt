The error is likely to be a `ValueError` because the code is trying to compare an integer with its own index, which is not valid.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    number = int(input())
    list = [2**i for i in range(33)]
    answer = []
    for i in list:
        if i <= number:
            answer.append('1' if i != 0 else '0')
        else:
            answer.append('0')
    print(''.join(answer))
```

In the fixed code, I changed `i <=list[i]` to `i <= number`, which makes sense because you're trying to check if each power of 2 is less than or equal to a given number. Also, in the `answer.append` statement, I added a condition to append '1' instead of '0' when `i != 0`. This is because you want to represent powers of 2 as '1's and non-powers of 2 as '0's in the binary representation of the number.
