The bug in this code is that it does not handle the case where `val` has less than 2 elements. This can happen if the input string `a` does not contain a space. In such cases, when you try to access `val[1]`, you will get an `IndexError`.

Here's a fixed version of your code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
while(t>0):
    a=(input())
    val=a.split(' ')
    if len(val) >= 2:
        b=int(val[1])
        print(int(math.log2(b)))
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter the correct format.")
    t -= 1
```

This code checks the length of `val` before trying to access its second element, and prints an error message if the input is invalid.
