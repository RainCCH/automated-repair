The bug is likely to be within the "IndexError: Array Index Out of Bounds" category. This is because you are trying to access elements at `index` and `index + 1` without checking if these indices are within the bounds of the list `data`.

Here's a fixed version of your code:

```python
def max_score(l, r):
    return min(r // l, l)


def solve():
    data = input().split()

    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        if index + 1 >= len(data): 
            break  # Check if there are enough elements left in the list
        l = int(data[index])
        r = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(max_score(l, r))

    for result in results:
        print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

In this fixed version, I added a check before trying to access elements at `index` and `index + 1`. If there are not enough elements left in the list, it breaks out of the loop. This prevents an "IndexError: Array Index Out of Bounds" from occurring.
