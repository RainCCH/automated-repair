The error is likely a `ValueError: Value with Unexpected Format Passed to the Function`. This is because you're trying to convert the output of `input().split()` directly into integers using `map(int, ...)`, but this will fail if any of the values in the input string are not numbers.

Here's a fixed version of your code:

```Python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = []
    for x in range(1, n//2+1):
        q.append(x)
        q.append(n+1-x)
    for x in q:
        print(x, end='')
```

In this code, I've wrapped the `input().split()` in a call to `map(int, ...)` like you originally intended. This will convert each value in the input string into an integer, or raise a `ValueError` if any of the values are not numbers.
