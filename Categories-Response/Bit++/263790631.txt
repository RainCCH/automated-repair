The error in your code is a TypeError. This is because you are trying to subtract from `X` which hasn't been defined, you have defined `x`. Also, the variable names are case sensitive.

Here's the fixed version of your code:

```
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n) :
    st = input()
    if st[1] == "+":
        x += 1
    else:
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

This code will work as long as the second character of each input string is either "+" or "-". If there's anything other than that, it will throw an IndexError.
