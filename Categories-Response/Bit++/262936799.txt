The error is that the variable `y` is not defined before using it in a for loop. 

Here's the fixed code:

```Python
y = int(input("Enter a value for y: "))
e=0
for i in range(y):
    u=list(str(x) for x in input("").split())
    for j in u:
        if j == "++X" or j=="X++":
            e+=1
        elif j== "--X" or j=="X--":
            e-=1
print(e)
```

In this code, I'm asking the user to enter a value for `y` before using it in the for loop. This way, you won't get an error when trying to use `y` without defining it first.
