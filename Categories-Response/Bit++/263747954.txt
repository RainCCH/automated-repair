A classic bug!

The error is a `NameError: Undefined Variable`. The variable `intput` should be replaced with the correct function name, which is `input`.

Here's the fixed code:

```
n = int(input())
x = 0
for i in range(n):
    st = input()
    if st[1] == '+':
        x += 1
    else:
        x -= 1
print(x)
```

Now, it should work correctly!
