The error in your code is a `NameError: Undefined Variable`. This is because you are using the variable `o` before it's defined. 

Here is the fixed version of your code:

```
t=int(input())
x=0  # Initialize x to 0
while t!=0:
    s=input()
    if s[1]=="+":
        x=x+1
    elif s[1]=="-":
        x=x-1
print(x)
```

In this fixed version, I initialized `x` to 0 before the loop starts. This way, you can start using `x` without getting a `NameError`.
