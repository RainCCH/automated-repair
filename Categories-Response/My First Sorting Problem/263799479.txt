The error in this code is that it's not considering the case when `x` and `y` are equal. The condition `if x<y:` will be true for both `x<y` and `y<x`. So, we need to add another condition to check if `x==y`.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x < y:
        print(x, " ", y)
    elif x == y:
        print(x, " ", y)
    else:
        print(y, " ", x)
```

In this code, I've also added an underscore `_` to the loop variable `i`, as it's a conventional practice in Python to use a single-letter variable like `_` when you don't plan to use the variable itself.
