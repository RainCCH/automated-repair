The error in your code is that you are trying to assign the value of `c` back to `x` and then to `y`, which does not make sense. It seems like you want to swap the values of `x` and `y` if `x > y`. Here's a corrected version:

```
t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    
    if x > y:
        x, y = y, x  # Swap the values of x and y
    
    print(str(x) + " " + str(y))
```

In this corrected code, `x, y = y, x` is a Pythonic way to swap the values of two variables.
