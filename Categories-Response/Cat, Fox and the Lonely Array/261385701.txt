The error in this code is likely to be a TypeError. The issue arises from the fact that `inp()` and `out()` are not functions, but rather variables that hold function objects.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```Python
import sys

inp = lambda: int(input())
out = lambda x: print(x)

t = inp()

ar2 = [0] * (10**5)


def findMaxDist(n):
    i = -1
    d = 0
    md = 1
    while i < n:
        d += 1
        i += 1
        if ar2[i]:
            md = max(md, d)
            d = 0

    return max(md, d)


for _ in range(t):
    n = inp()
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxDist = 1

    for i in range(20):
        a = 2**i
        br = True
        ig = True
        for j in range(n):
            ar2[j] = ar[j] & a
            if ar2[j]:
                ig = False
            if ar[j] >= a:
                br = False
        if br:
            break
        if ig:
            continue
        maxDist = max(findMaxDist(n), maxDist)

    out(maxDist)
```

The main changes are:

1. The `inp()` and `out()` variables have been replaced with lambda functions.

2. The `input()` function has been used to read the input instead of trying to use the non-existent `sys.stdin.readline` and `sys.stdout.write`.

3. The line where you calculate `maxDist` has been moved inside the loop, so that it gets updated for each possible maximum distance.

4. The last line where you print `maxDist` now uses the lambda function `out()`.
