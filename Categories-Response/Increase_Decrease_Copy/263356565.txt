The error in your code is due to the fact that you're trying to access `arrA` and `arrB` beyond their lengths. 

The corrected version of your code would be:

```
n=int(input())
arrA=[]
arrB=[]
arrA_input = input().split(',')
for num in arrA_input:
    arrA.append(int(num))
arrB_input = input().split(',')
for num in arrB_input:
    arrB.append(int(num))

if len(arrA) != n+1 or len(arrB) != n+1:
    print("Error: The arrays are not of the correct length.")
else:
    arrA.append(arrB[-1])
    count=0
    for i in range(n+1):
        if arrA[i]!=arrB[i]:
            value=abs(arrA[i]-arrB[i])
            count=count+value
    print(count)
```

This code will first check if the lengths of `arrA` and `arrB` are equal to `n+1`. If they're not, it will print an error message. Then it will calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements in `arrA` and `arrB`, sum them up, and print the result.
