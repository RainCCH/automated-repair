The bug in this code is likely a `ValueError` because the program is trying to compare characters (like 'A' or 'B') with integers. This occurs when it tries to calculate the difference between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[n])` where `a` and `b` are strings.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```
t = int(input()) 
output = []

for k in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().split()  #length of a = n
    b = input().split()  #length of a = n+1

    steps = 0
    diff = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if(int(b[i])<int(a[i])):
            steps += int(a[i])-int(b[i])
        else:
            steps += int(b[i])-int(a[i])

    final = steps + diff 

    output.append(final)

print(output)
```

In this fixed version, I'm assuming that `a` and `b` are lists of integers separated by spaces. The program calculates the minimum number of operations needed to convert list `a` into list `b`.
