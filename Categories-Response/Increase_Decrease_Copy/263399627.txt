The error is likely a `NameError: Undefined Variable` because the variable `maxSize` is not defined. 

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
t = int(input())
while(t):
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += abs(a[i]-b[i])

    flag = 1


    for i in range(n):
        if(a[i]>=b[i]):
            if(b[i]<=b[-1]<=a[i]):
                flag = 0
                break
        else:
            if(a[i]<=b[-1]<=b[i]):
                flag = 0
                break

    mn = 0
    if(flag):
        for i in range(n):
            mn = min(mn,abs(b[-1]-b[i]))
        for i in range(n):
            mn = min(mn,abs(b[-1]-a[i]))

    print(res+mn+1)
```

In the original code, `maxSize` is not defined anywhere. I removed it because it's not used anywhere else in the code.
