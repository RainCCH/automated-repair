The error in your code is a `NameError` because the variable `results` is used but never defined. 

Also, there's no need to store results if you're not going to use them anywhere.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```Python
rounds = int(input())
for _ in range(rounds):
    n=int(input())
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1+p2+p3)%2!=0:
        print(-1)
    elif (p1+p2) >= p3:
        print((p1+p2+p3)//2)
    else:
        print(p1+p2)
```

This code will work as long as the number of rounds, `n`, is equal to 1. If you want it to work for more than one round, you'll need to modify the code to keep track of the results.
