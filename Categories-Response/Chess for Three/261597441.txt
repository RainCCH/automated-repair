The error in the code is a TypeError. The issue arises from this line: `spectetor = arr[i]`. Here, `arr` is a list and `i` is an integer index. You can't assign an integer to a string.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```
def main():
    n = int(input())
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    spectator = 0
    winner = 0
    end = "YES"
    
    while n != 0:
        winner = int(input())
        if winner != spectator:
            for i in range(3):
                if arr[i] != winner and arr[i] != spectator:
                    spectator = arr[i]
                    break
        else:
            end = "NO"
            break
        n -= 1
    
    print(end)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version, I changed the name of `spectetor` to `spectator`. This is because `spectetor` was initially initialized as a string (`3`).
