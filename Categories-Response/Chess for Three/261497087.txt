The error in the code is likely a TypeError, specifically "Wrong Variable Type". This is because you are trying to iterate over the result of `input()` which is expected to be an integer, but it's not.

Here's the corrected version:

```Python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
    if (a+b+c)%2!=0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        cur = sorted([a, b, c])
        ans = 0
        while cur[1] > 0:
            ans += 1
            cur[1] -= 1
            cur[2] -= 1
            cur = sorted(cur)
        print(ans)
```

In this corrected version, I first read the number of test cases as an integer using `int(input())`. Then, in the for loop, I used `_` to ignore the variable and simply iterate `n` times.
