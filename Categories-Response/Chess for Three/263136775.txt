The error in the provided code is that it does not handle the case when `p1`, `p2` and `p3` are equal. According to the rules of Chess (Fisher's combination), if all three numbers are equal, it should return `-1`.

Here is a fixed version of the code:

```Python
def chess_for_three(p1, p2, p3):
    if p1 == p2 == p3:
        return -1
    elif (p1 + p2) <= p3:
        return p1 + p2
    else:
        return int((p1+p2+p3)/2)

num=int(input())
for i in range(num):
    p1=int(input())
    p2=int(input())
    p3=int(input())
    print(chess_for_three(p1, p2, p3))
```

This code will correctly calculate the winner of a game of Three Player Chess based on the rules provided.
