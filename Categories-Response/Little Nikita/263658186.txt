The bug in this code is likely to be within the category "SyntaxError: Invalid Syntax" or "TypeError: Wrong Variable Type". The error occurs because you are trying to print a variable `Yes` and `No` without using `print()` function.

Here's the fixed version of your code:

```Python
n,m = input().split(" ")
n,m = int(n) , int(m)
if n >= 1 and m <= 100:
    if n >= m:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

In this corrected version, I have used `print()` function to print the values of `Yes` and `No`. Now the code should run without any errors.
