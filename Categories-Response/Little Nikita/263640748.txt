The error in your code is a syntax error. The line `if(x==0) and (m>n):` should be changed to `if x == 0 and m > n:` because Python uses indentation to denote block-level structure, such as if/else statements.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```
t = int(input())
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    x = (m+n) % 2
    if x == 0 and m > n:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

while t > 0:
    solve()
    t -= 1
```

I also changed `t = t-1` to `t -= 1`, which is the standard way in Python to decrement a variable.
