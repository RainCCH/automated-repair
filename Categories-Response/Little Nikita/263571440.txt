The error in the code is likely a `ValueError` because the `input().split()` function returns a list of strings, and you are trying to compare these strings with integers.

Here's the fixed version of your code:

```Python
e = int(input())
while e != 0: 
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m > n:
        print("no")
    else:
        if m == n or (m % 2) == 0:
            print ("yes")
        else:
            print("no")
    e = e - 1
```

In this fixed code, I used the `map(int, ...)` function to convert the strings returned by `input().split()` into integers. This should fix the `ValueError` and allow your program to run correctly.
