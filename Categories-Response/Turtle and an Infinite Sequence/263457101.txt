The error is likely due to `|` operator being used for bitwise OR operation which requires integer operands. In your code, you are performing this operation on elements of list `a`, which are integers in one iteration and lists in the next iteration.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```Python
def get_an(n, m):
    # The initial sequence is 0, 1, 2, ...
    a = [i for i in range(n + 1)]

    # Simulate the changes for m seconds.
    for _ in range(m):
        # Update the elements of the sequence.
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] | (a[i] & a[i - 1])
        # Update the first element.
        a[0] = a[0] | a[1]

    # Return the value of a_n.
    return a[n]


# Get the number of test cases.
t = int(input())

# Process each test case.
for _ in range(t):
    # Get the values of n and m.
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

    # Calculate the value of a_n and print it.
    print(get_an(n, m))
```

This code calculates the nth element of the sequence `a` after `m` iterations. The sequence is updated according to the rules provided: each element becomes the bitwise OR of its two adjacent elements (including the first and last elements).
