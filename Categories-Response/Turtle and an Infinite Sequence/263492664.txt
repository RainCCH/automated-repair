The error in your code is due to the fact that you are not considering the cases when `msb_p1` and `msb_p2` are different. In such cases, you need to find the maximum of `msb_p1` and `msb_p2` and then add all the bits from that position up to 0th bit in the result.

Here is the corrected code:

```Python
# Returns the Most Significant Bit Position (MSB)
def MSBPosition(N):
    msb_p = -1
    while N:
        N = N >> 1
        msb_p += 1
    return msb_p

# Returns the Bitwise OR of all integers between L and R
def findBitwiseOR(L, R):
    res = 0

    # Find the MSB position in L
    msb_p1 = MSBPosition(L)

    # Find the MSB position in R
    msb_p2 = MSBPosition(R)

    while msb_p1 == msb_p2:
        res_val = 1 << msb_p1

        # Add this value until msb_p1 and msb_p2 are same;
        res += res_val

        L -= res_val
        R -= res_val

        # Calculate msb_p1 and msb_p2
        msb_p1 = MSBPosition(L)
        msb_p2 = MSBPosition(R)

    # Find the maximum of msb_p1 and msb_p2
    max_msb = max(msb_p1, msb_p2)

    # Set all the bits from max_msb up to 0th bit in the result
    for i in range(max_msb, -1, -1):
        res_val = 1 << i
        res += res_val

    return res

# Driver Code
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    L = max(0, n - m)
    R = n + m
    print(findBitwiseOR(L, R))
```

This corrected code will work correctly even when `msb_p1` and `msb_p2` are different. It finds the maximum of `msb_p1` and `msb_p2`, then sets all the bits from that position up to 0th bit in the result.
