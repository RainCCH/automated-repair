The error is likely to be of the type "TypeError: Wrong Variable Type". This is because you are trying to perform bitwise OR operation on an integer and another integer. The correct way to do this would be to convert those integers into binary strings, perform the bitwise OR operation, then convert back into an integer.

Here's the corrected code:

```Python
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    a = 0
    if m == 0:
        print(n)
    else:
        for i in range(max(0,n-m),n+m+1,1):
            a = a|(1 << (i % 2))
        print(a)
```

In this code, the bitwise OR operation is performed by shifting the bits of `1` to the left by `(i % 2)` places and then performing the OR operation. This simulates the effect of performing the bitwise OR operation on all integers from `n-m` to `n+m`.
